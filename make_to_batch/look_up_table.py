"""The look-up tables.

This module contains a look-up tables that can be used to convert a command from
a Makefile (Linux) to its batch equivalent. Each look-up table is a dictionary
where the keys are the Linux command and the values are dictionaries containing
the batch command and its options. The options are then stored as another
dictionary where the key represents the Linux command option and the value
represents its batch equivalent.

A simple dictionary is exposed of type ``Dict[str, Dict[str, Union[str,
Dict[str, str]]]]``.  The keys of the dictionary are the Unix commands to be
translated, the value is, instead, another dictionary having two available
keys:

* ``command``: a string containing the Windows command that corresponds to the
  Unix one.
* ``options``: a dictionary containing, for each option of the Unix command,
  the corresponding option in Windows.
